# FAQ 
**When can I register to vote?**

Each state has different laws, but in **some** states you can [pre-register](http://www.fairvote.org/voter_pre_registration#facts_about_voter_pre_registration){:target="_blank"} as young as 16 years old!

**What's the difference between voter pre-registration and voter registration?**

The only difference is that you can't vote immediately after pre-registering. The state will automatically register you to vote when you turn 18, so you're just as "registered" as normally registered voters!
